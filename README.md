The AirBnB clone project  The goal of the project is to deploy on your server a simple copy of the AirBnB website.
For the project we are going to implement:
  - A command interpreter to manipulate data without a visual interface, like in a Shell (perfect for development and debugging)
  - A website (the front-end) that shows the final product to everybody: static and dynamic
  - A database or files that store data (data = objects)
  - An API that provides a communication interface between the front-end and your data (retrieve, create, delete, update them)
